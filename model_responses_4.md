To solve the problem, we will use geometric properties and algebraic manipulations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the properties and relationships**:
   - Given \(BC = 108\), \(CA = 126\), and \(AB = 39\).
   - \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\), so by the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}\).
   - Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we have \(13k + 36k = 126\), so \(49k = 126\) and \(k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}\). Therefore, \(AX = \frac{234}{7}\) and \(XC = \frac{648}{7}\).
   - Since \(CX = CY\), point \(Y\) lies on the circle centered at \(C\) with radius \(CX\).

2. **Circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\)**:
   - The circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(\triangle ABX\) passes through points \(A\), \(B\), and \(X\).

3. **Intersection of \(XY\) with \(BC\)**:
   - Since \(Y\) is on the circumcircle \(\omega\) and \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) over the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).
   - Let \(E\) be the intersection of \(XY\) with \(BC\). Since \(CX = CY\), \(E\) is the midpoint of \(BC\).

4. **Calculate \(BE\)**:
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BE = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{108}{2} = 54\).

The length of segment \(BE\) is \(54\), which can be written as \(\frac{54}{1}\), where \(m = 54\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 54 + 1 = 55\).

Let's confirm this with Python and sympy:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Given lengths
BC = 108
CA = 126
AB = 39

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = symbols('k')
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k
eq = Eq(AX + XC, CA)
k_value = solve(eq, k)[0]

# Calculate AX and XC
AX_value = 13 * k_value
XC_value = 36 * k_value

# Since CX = CY, Y is the reflection of X over the perpendicular bisector of BC
# E is the midpoint of BC
BE = BC / 2

# m and n
m = int(BE)
n = 1

# m + n
result = m + n
print(result)
```

=====================


=== Model Response ===
To solve the problem, we start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem. According to the theorem, since \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\), we have:

\[
\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
\]

Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we can write:

\[
13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
AX = 13k = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad XC = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}
\]

Since \(CX = CY\), we have \(CY = \frac{648}{7}\). Now, we need to find the length of segment \(BE\). Since \(Y\) lies on the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\) and \(CX = CY\), \(\triangle CXY\) is isosceles with \(CX = CY\). The line \(XY\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(CD\) where \(D\) is the midpoint of \(XY\).

Using the Power of a Point theorem at point \(E\) with respect to the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\), we have:

\[
BE \cdot EC = AE \cdot EX
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(E\) is the harmonic conjugate of \(C\) with respect to \(B\) and \(X\). The harmonic division property gives us:

\[
\frac{BE}{EC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{39}{126} = \frac{13}{42}
\]

Let \(BE = 13m\) and \(EC = 42m\). Since \(BE + EC = BC = 108\), we can write:

\[
13m + 42m = 108 \implies 55m = 108 \implies m = \frac{108}{55}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
BE = 13m = 13 \cdot \frac{108}{55} = \frac{1404}{55}
\]

The length of segment \(BE\) is \(\frac{1404}{55}\). Since \(m = 1404\) and \(n = 55\) are coprime, we have \(m+n = 1404 + 55 = 1459\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1459}
\]

To solve the problem, we will use geometric properties and algebraic calculations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the properties and use the Angle Bisector Theorem**: Since $BX$ bisects $\angle CBA$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}$. Let $AX = 13k$ and $XC = 36k$. Since $AX + XC = AC = 126$, we have $13k + 36k = 126$, so $49k = 126$ and $k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}$. Therefore, $AX = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}$ and $XC = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}$.

2. **Circumcircle and point $Y$**: Since $CX = CY$, point $Y$ lies on the circle centered at $C$ with radius $CX$. Since $Y$ is also on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$, it must lie on the intersection of these two circles. The line $XY$ will intersect $BC$ at point $E$.

3. **Use Power of a Point Theorem**: By the Power of a Point Theorem applied to point $C$ with respect to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$, we have $CX \cdot CY = CA \cdot CD$, where $D$ is the second intersection of $CX$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$. Since $CX = CY$, we have $CX^2 = CA \cdot CD$. We can use this to find the length of $CD$.

4. **Calculate the length of $BE$**: Using the properties of similar triangles and the fact that $CX = CY$, we can find the length of $BE$.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Given lengths
BC = 108
CA = 126
AB = 39

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k

# Using Power of a Point Theorem
CX = XC
CA = 126
# Let CD = x
x = sp.symbols('x')
eq = sp.Eq(CX**2, CA * x)
CD = sp.solve(eq, x)[0]

# Since D is on the circumcircle and CD is a chord, we can use the properties of similar triangles
# to find the length of BE. Let BE = y and EC = 108 - y
y = sp.symbols('y')
# Using the fact that triangles CBE and CAX are similar (since they share angle C and angle BEC = angle AXB)
# we have BE / EC = AX / XC
eq2 = sp.Eq(y / (108 - y), AX / XC)
BE = sp.solve(eq2, y)[0]

# Simplify the fraction
BE = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE.as_numer_denom()
result = m + n

print(result)
```

To solve the problem, we start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of \(\angle CBA\) divides the opposite side \(AC\) into segments proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
\]

Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we can write:

\[
13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
AX = 13k = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}, \quad XC = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}
\]

Next, we note that \(Y\) is a point on the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\) such that \(CX = CY = \frac{648}{7}\). Since \(CX = CY\), \(C\) is the midpoint of arc \(XY\) not containing \(A\) and \(B\). Therefore, \(XY\) is parallel to \(AB\).

Now, we need to find the length of segment \(BE\), where \(E\) is the intersection of \(XY\) and \(BC\). Since \(XY \parallel AB\), \(\triangle CXY\) is similar to \(\triangle CAB\) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the segments into which \(C\) divides \(AC\):

\[
\frac{CY}{CA} = \frac{\frac{648}{7}}{126} = \frac{648}{7 \cdot 126} = \frac{648}{882} = \frac{36}{49}
\]

Since \(\triangle CXY \sim \triangle CAB\), the ratio of \(CE\) to \(CB\) is also \(\frac{36}{49}\):

\[
\frac{CE}{CB} = \frac{36}{49} \implies CE = \frac{36}{49} \cdot 108 = \frac{3888}{49}
\]

The length of segment \(BE\) is:

\[
BE = BC - CE = 108 - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{5292}{49} - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{1404}{49}
\]

Thus, the length of segment \(BE\) is \(\frac{1404}{49}\). Since 1404 and 49 are coprime, we have \(m = 1404\) and \(n = 49\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1404 + 49 = 1453\).

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1453}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to use several geometric properties and theorems. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the Angle Bisector and Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**:
   Since \( BX \) bisects \( \angle CBA \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{AB}{CB} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
   \]
   Let \( AX = 13k \) and \( CX = 36k \). Since \( AX + CX = AC = 126 \), we have:
   \[
   13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
   \]
   Therefore, \( CX = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7} \).

2. **Circumcircle and Similar Triangles**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( \triangle CYX \) is isosceles with \( CY = CX = \frac{648}{7} \). The circumcircle \( \omega \) of \( \triangle ABX \) intersects \( CY \) at \( Y \), and since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) is the reflection of \( X \) across the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \).

3. **Find the Coordinates of Points**:
   We can use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of \( E \). Place \( B \) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \( C \) at \((108, 0)\), and find the coordinates of \( A \) using the distance formula. Then, find the coordinates of \( X \) using the ratio \( \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{13}{36} \).

4. **Equation of Line \( XY \)**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \). The coordinates of \( Y \) can be found using the circumcircle properties. The line \( XY \) intersects \( BC \) at \( E \).

5. **Calculate the Length of \( BE \)**:
   Using the coordinates of \( E \), we can find the length of \( BE \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the coordinates of points B, C, and A
B = sp.Point(0, 0)
C = sp.Point(108, 0)
A = sp.Point(126 * 108 / 145, 126 * 39 / 145)

# Calculate the coordinates of X using the ratio AX/CX = 13/36
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
X = sp.Point(13 * 108 / 49, 13 * 39 / 49)

# Calculate the circumcircle of triangle ABX
circumcircle = sp.Circle(A, B, X)

# Define the line CY, which is the perpendicular bisector of BC
perpendicular_bisector = sp.Line((54, 0), slope=sp.oo)

# Find the intersection of the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisector to get Y
Y = circumcircle.intersection(perpendicular_bisector)[0]

# Define the line XY
line_XY = sp.Line(X, Y)

# Find the intersection of line XY with BC
E = line_XY.intersection(sp.Line(B, C))[0]

# Calculate the length of BE
BE = B.distance(E)

# Simplify the fraction
BE_simplified = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE_simplified.as_numer_denom()

# Calculate m + n
result = m + n
print(result)
```

To solve the problem, we start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem. According to the theorem, since \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\), we have:
\[
\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}.
\]
Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we have:
\[
13k + 36k = 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}.
\]
Thus, \(AX = 13k = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}\) and \(XC = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}\).

Next, we note that \(CX = CY = \frac{648}{7}\). Since \(Y\) lies on the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\) and \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) across the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\) in the circumcircle. Therefore, \(XY\) is parallel to \(AB\).

Now, we need to find the length of segment \(BE\). Since \(XY \parallel AB\), \(\triangle CXY \sim \triangle CAB\) by AA similarity. The ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the segments into which \(X\) divides \(AC\):
\[
\frac{CX}{CA} = \frac{\frac{648}{7}}{126} = \frac{648}{7 \cdot 126} = \frac{648}{882} = \frac{36}{49}.
\]
Thus, the ratio of \(CE\) to \(CB\) is also \(\frac{36}{49}\):
\[
\frac{CE}{CB} = \frac{36}{49} \implies CE = \frac{36}{49} \cdot 108 = \frac{3888}{49}.
\]
Therefore, the length of segment \(BE\) is:
\[
BE = CB - CE = 108 - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{5292}{49} - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{1404}{49}.
\]
The length of segment \(BE\) is \(\frac{1404}{49}\). Since 1404 and 49 are coprime, we have \(m = 1404\) and \(n = 49\). Thus, \(m + n = 1404 + 49 = 1453\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1453}.

=== Model Response ===
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(BC = 108\), \(CA = 126\), and \(AB = 39\).
   - Point \(X\) lies on segment \(AC\) such that \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\).
   - \(\omega\) is the circumcircle of triangle \(ABX\).
   - Point \(Y\) on \(\omega\) is such that \(CX = CY\).
   - Line \(XY\) meets \(BC\) at \(E\).
   - We need to find the length of segment \(BE\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) and then find \(m + n\).

2. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}\).
   - Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we have \(13k + 36k = 126\), so \(49k = 126\) and \(k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}\).
   - Therefore, \(AX = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}\) and \(XC = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}\).

3. **Circumcircle and Point \(Y\):**
   - Since \(CX = CY\), point \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) over the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).
   - The circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABX\) passes through \(A\), \(B\), and \(X\).

4. **Find the Length \(BE\):**
   - By the Power of a Point theorem, \(BE \cdot BC = BX \cdot BY\).
   - Since \(CX = CY\), \(BY = BX\).
   - Therefore, \(BE \cdot BC = BX^2\).
   - We can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \(BX\):
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{AB \cdot BC \left(1 - \frac{AC^2}{(AB + BC)^2}\right)}
     \]
     Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{126^2}{(39 + 108)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{126^2}{147^2}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{36}{49}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \cdot \frac{13}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{39 \cdot 108 \cdot 13}{49}} = \frac{39 \cdot 6 \cdot \sqrt{13}}{7} = \frac{234 \sqrt{13}}{7}
     \]
   - Therefore, \(BE \cdot 108 = \left(\frac{234 \sqrt{13}}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{234^2 \cdot 13}{49}\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     BE \cdot 108 = \frac{54756 \cdot 13}{49} = \frac{711828}{49}
     \]
     So,
     \[
     BE = \frac{711828}{49 \cdot 108} = \frac{711828}{5392} = \frac{177957}{1348}
     \]
     Simplifying the fraction, we get:
     \[
     BE = \frac{177957}{1348}
     \]
     The values \(m = 177957\) and \(n = 1348\) are coprime. Therefore, \(m + n = 177957 + 1348 = 179305\).

Let's implement this in Python to verify the calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Given values
AB = 39
BC = 108
CA = 126

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = sp.Rational(126, 49)
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k

# Length of the angle bisector BX
BX = sp.sqrt(AB * BC * (1 - (CA**2 / (AB + BC)**2)))

# BE * BC = BX^2
BE = sp.Rational(BX**2, BC)

# Simplify the fraction
BE_simplified = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE_simplified.as_numer_denom()

# Sum of m and n
result = m + n
print(result)
```

=====================


=== Model Response ===
To solve the problem, we start by using the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of \(\angle CBA\) divides the opposite side \(AC\) into segments proportional to the other two sides of the triangle. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
\]

Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we can write:

\[
13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
AX = 13k = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7} \quad \text{and} \quad XC = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}
\]

Next, we know that \(CX = CY = \frac{648}{7}\). Since \(Y\) lies on the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\) and \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) across the perpendicular bisector of \(AC\). The line \(XY\) is parallel to \(AB\), and it intersects \(BC\) at \(E\).

Since \(XY \parallel AB\), \(\triangle CXY\) is similar to \(\triangle CAB\) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:

\[
\frac{CE}{CB} = \frac{CX}{CA} = \frac{\frac{648}{7}}{126} = \frac{648}{7 \cdot 126} = \frac{648}{882} = \frac{36}{49}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
CE = \frac{36}{49} \cdot CB = \frac{36}{49} \cdot 108 = \frac{3888}{49}
\]

The length of segment \(BE\) is:

\[
BE = CB - CE = 108 - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{5292}{49} - \frac{3888}{49} = \frac{1404}{49}
\]

Therefore, the length of segment \(BE\) is \(\frac{1404}{49}\). Since 1404 and 49 are coprime, we have \(m = 1404\) and \(n = 49\). The sum \(m + n\) is:

\[
m + n = 1404 + 49 = 1453
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1453}
\]

To solve the problem, we will use geometric properties and algebraic manipulations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the properties and relationships**:
   - Given \(BC = 108\), \(CA = 126\), and \(AB = 39\).
   - \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\), so by the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}\).
   - Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we have \(13k + 36k = 126\), so \(49k = 126\) and \(k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}\). Therefore, \(AX = \frac{234}{7}\) and \(XC = \frac{648}{7}\).
   - Since \(CX = CY\), point \(Y\) lies on the circle centered at \(C\) with radius \(CX\).

2. **Circumcircle of \(\triangle ABX\)**:
   - The circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(\triangle ABX\) passes through points \(A\), \(B\), and \(X\).

3. **Intersection of \(XY\) with \(BC\)**:
   - Since \(Y\) is on the circumcircle \(\omega\) and \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) over the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).
   - Let \(E\) be the intersection of \(XY\) with \(BC\). Since \(CX = CY\), \(E\) is the midpoint of \(BC\).

4. **Calculate \(BE\)**:
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BE = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{108}{2} = 54\).

The length of segment \(BE\) is \(54\), which can be written as \(\frac{54}{1}\), where \(m = 54\) and \(n = 1\). Therefore, \(m + n = 54 + 1 = 55\).

Let's confirm this with Python and sympy:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Given lengths
BC = 108
CA = 126
AB = 39

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = symbols('k')
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k
eq = Eq(AX + XC, CA)
k_value = solve(eq, k)[0]

# Calculate AX and XC
AX_value = 13 * k_value
XC_value = 36 * k_value

# Since CX = CY, Y is the reflection of X over the perpendicular bisector of BC
# E is the midpoint of BC
BE = BC / 2

# m and n
m = int(BE)
n = 1

# m + n
result = m + n
print(result)

To solve the problem, we will use geometric properties and algebraic calculations. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the properties and use the Angle Bisector Theorem**: Since $BX$ bisects $\angle CBA$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have $\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}$. Let $AX = 13k$ and $XC = 36k$. Since $AX + XC = AC = 126$, we have $13k + 36k = 126$, so $49k = 126$ and $k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}$. Therefore, $AX = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}$ and $XC = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}$.

2. **Circumcircle and point $Y$**: Since $CX = CY$, point $Y$ lies on the circle centered at $C$ with radius $CX$. Since $Y$ is also on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$, it must lie on the intersection of these two circles. The line $XY$ will intersect $BC$ at point $E$.

3. **Use Power of a Point Theorem**: By the Power of a Point Theorem applied to point $C$ with respect to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$, we have $CX \cdot CY = CA \cdot CD$, where $D$ is the second intersection of $CX$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle ABX$. Since $CX = CY$, we have $CX^2 = CA \cdot CD$. We can use this to find the length of $CD$.

4. **Calculate the length of $BE$**: Using the properties of similar triangles and the fact that $CX = CY$, we can find the length of $BE$.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Given lengths
BC = 108
CA = 126
AB = 39

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k

# Using Power of a Point Theorem
CX = XC
CA = 126
# Let CD = x
x = sp.symbols('x')
eq = sp.Eq(CX**2, CA * x)
CD = sp.solve(eq, x)[0]

# Since D is on the circumcircle and CD is a chord, we can use the properties of similar triangles
# to find the length of BE. Let BE = y and EC = 108 - y
y = sp.symbols('y')
# Using the fact that triangles CBE and CAX are similar (since they share angle C and angle BEC = angle AXB)
# we have BE / EC = AX / XC
eq2 = sp.Eq(y / (108 - y), AX / XC)
BE = sp.solve(eq2, y)[0]

# Simplify the fraction
BE = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE.as_numer_denom()
result = m + n

To solve the problem, we need to use several geometric properties and theorems. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the Angle Bisector and Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**:
   Since \( BX \) bisects \( \angle CBA \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{AB}{CB} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
   \]
   Let \( AX = 13k \) and \( CX = 36k \). Since \( AX + CX = AC = 126 \), we have:
   \[
   13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
   \]
   Therefore, \( CX = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7} \).

2. **Circumcircle and Similar Triangles**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( \triangle CYX \) is isosceles with \( CY = CX = \frac{648}{7} \). The circumcircle \( \omega \) of \( \triangle ABX \) intersects \( CY \) at \( Y \), and since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) is the reflection of \( X \) across the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \).

3. **Find the Coordinates of Points**:
   We can use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of \( E \). Place \( B \) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \( C \) at \((108, 0)\), and find the coordinates of \( A \) using the distance formula. Then, find the coordinates of \( X \) using the ratio \( \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{13}{36} \).

4. **Equation of Line \( XY \)**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \). The coordinates of \( Y \) can be found using the circumcircle properties. The line \( XY \) intersects \( BC \) at \( E \).

5. **Calculate the Length of \( BE \)**:
   Using the coordinates of \( E \), we can find the length of \( BE \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the coordinates of points B, C, and A
B = sp.Point(0, 0)
C = sp.Point(108, 0)
A = sp.Point(126 * 108 / 145, 126 * 39 / 145)

# Calculate the coordinates of X using the ratio AX/CX = 13/36
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
X = sp.Point(13 * 108 / 49, 13 * 39 / 49)

# Calculate the circumcircle of triangle ABX
circumcircle = sp.Circle(A, B, X)

# Define the line CY, which is the perpendicular bisector of BC
perpendicular_bisector = sp.Line((54, 0), slope=sp.oo)

# Find the intersection of the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisector to get Y

# Find the intersection of line XY with BC
E = line_XY.intersection(sp.Line(B, C))[0]

# Calculate the length of BE

Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a triangle \(ABC\) with sides \(BC = 108\), \(CA = 126\), and \(AB = 39\).
   - Point \(X\) lies on segment \(AC\) such that \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\).
   - \(\omega\) is the circumcircle of triangle \(ABX\).
   - Point \(Y\) on \(\omega\) is such that \(CX = CY\).
   - Line \(XY\) meets \(BC\) at \(E\).
   - We need to find the length of segment \(BE\) in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\) and then find \(m + n\).

2. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(\frac{AX}{XC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}\).
   - Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(XC = 36k\). Since \(AX + XC = AC = 126\), we have \(13k + 36k = 126\), so \(49k = 126\) and \(k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}\).
   - Therefore, \(AX = 13 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{234}{7}\) and \(XC = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}\).

3. **Circumcircle and Point \(Y\):**
   - Since \(CX = CY\), point \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) over the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).
   - The circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABX\) passes through \(A\), \(B\), and \(X\).

4. **Find the Length \(BE\):**
   - By the Power of a Point theorem, \(BE \cdot BC = BX \cdot BY\).
   - Since \(CX = CY\), \(BY = BX\).
   - Therefore, \(BE \cdot BC = BX^2\).
   - We can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector \(BX\):
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{AB \cdot BC \left(1 - \frac{AC^2}{(AB + BC)^2}\right)}
     \]
     Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{126^2}{(39 + 108)^2}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{126^2}{147^2}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \left(1 - \frac{36}{49}\right)} = \sqrt{39 \cdot 108 \cdot \frac{13}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{39 \cdot 108 \cdot 13}{49}} = \frac{39 \cdot 6 \cdot \sqrt{13}}{7} = \frac{234 \sqrt{13}}{7}
     \]
   - Therefore, \(BE \cdot 108 = \left(\frac{234 \sqrt{13}}{7}\right)^2 = \frac{234^2 \cdot 13}{49}\).
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     BE \cdot 108 = \frac{54756 \cdot 13}{49} = \frac{711828}{49}
     \]
     So,
     \[
     BE = \frac{711828}{49 \cdot 108} = \frac{711828}{5392} = \frac{177957}{1348}
     \]
     Simplifying the fraction, we get:
     \[
     BE = \frac{177957}{1348}
     \]
     The values \(m = 177957\) and \(n = 1348\) are coprime. Therefore, \(m + n = 177957 + 1348 = 179305\).

Let's implement this in Python to verify the calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Given values
AB = 39
BC = 108
CA = 126

# Using the Angle Bisector Theorem
k = sp.Rational(126, 49)
AX = 13 * k
XC = 36 * k

# Length of the angle bisector BX
BX = sp.sqrt(AB * BC * (1 - (CA**2 / (AB + BC)**2)))

# BE * BC = BX^2
BE = sp.Rational(BX**2, BC)

# Simplify the fraction
BE_simplified = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE_simplified.as_numer_denom()

# Sum of m and n
result = m + n
print(result)

It seems there was an issue with finding the intersection of the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisector. Let's re-evaluate the steps and ensure we correctly find the coordinates of \(Y\).

1. **Identify the Angle Bisector and Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**:
   Since \(BX\) bisects \(\angle CBA\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{AB}{CB} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
   \]
   Let \(AX = 13k\) and \(CX = 36k\). Since \(AX + CX = AC = 126\), we have:
   \[
   13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
   \]
   Therefore, \(CX = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7}\).

2. **Circumcircle and Similar Triangles**:
   Since \(CX = CY\), \(\triangle CYX\) is isosceles with \(CY = CX = \frac{648}{7}\). The circumcircle \(\omega\) of \(\triangle ABX\) intersects \(CY\) at \(Y\), and since \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) is the reflection of \(X\) across the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\).

3. **Find the Coordinates of Points**:
   Place \(B\) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \(C\) at \((108, 0)\), and find the coordinates of \(A\) using the distance formula. Then, find the coordinates of \(X\) using the ratio \(\frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{13}{36}\).

4. **Equation of Line \(XY\)**:
   Since \(CX = CY\), \(Y\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\). The coordinates of \(Y\) can be found using the circumcircle properties. The line \(XY\) intersects \(BC\) at \(E\).

5. **Calculate the Length of \(BE\)**:
   Using the coordinates of \(E\), we can find the length of \(BE\).

Let's re-implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the coordinates of points B, C, and A
B = sp.Point(0, 0)
C = sp.Point(108, 0)
A = sp.Point(126 * 108 / 145, 126 * 39 / 145)

# Calculate the coordinates of X using the ratio AX/CX = 13/36
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
X = sp.Point(13 * 108 / 49, 13 * 39 / 49)

# Calculate the circumcircle of triangle ABX
circumcircle = sp.Circle(A, B, X)

# Define the line CY, which is the perpendicular bisector of BC
perpendicular_bisector = sp.Line((54, 0), slope=sp.oo)

# Find the intersection of the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisector to get Y
Y = sp.Point(54, X[1])

# Define the line XY
line_XY = sp.Line(X, Y)

# Find the intersection of line XY with BC
E = line_XY.intersection(sp.Line(B, C))[0]

# Calculate the length of BE
BE = B.distance(E)

# Simplify the fraction
BE_simplified = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE_simplified.as_numer_denom()

# Calculate m + n
result = m + n

To solve the problem, we need to use several geometric properties and theorems. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

1. **Identify the Angle Bisector and Use the Angle Bisector Theorem**:
   Since \( BX \) bisects \( \angle CBA \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{AB}{CB} = \frac{39}{108} = \frac{13}{36}
   \]
   Let \( AX = 13k \) and \( CX = 36k \). Since \( AX + CX = AC = 126 \), we have:
   \[
   13k + 36k = 126 \implies 49k = 126 \implies k = \frac{126}{49} = \frac{18}{7}
   \]
   Therefore, \( CX = 36k = 36 \cdot \frac{18}{7} = \frac{648}{7} \).

2. **Circumcircle and Similar Triangles**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( \triangle CYX \) is isosceles with \( CY = CX = \frac{648}{7} \). The circumcircle \( \omega \) of \( \triangle ABX \) intersects \( CY \) at \( Y \), and since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) is the reflection of \( X \) across the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \).

3. **Find the Coordinates of Points**:
   We can use coordinate geometry to find the coordinates of \( E \). Place \( B \) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \( C \) at \((108, 0)\), and find the coordinates of \( A \) using the distance formula. Then, find the coordinates of \( X \) using the ratio \( \frac{AX}{CX} = \frac{13}{36} \).

4. **Equation of Line \( XY \)**:
   Since \( CX = CY \), \( Y \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \). The coordinates of \( Y \) can be found using the circumcircle properties. The line \( XY \) intersects \( BC \) at \( E \).

5. **Calculate the Length of \( BE \)**:
   Using the coordinates of \( E \), we can find the length of \( BE \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the coordinates of points B, C, and A
B = sp.Point(0, 0)
C = sp.Point(108, 0)
A = sp.Point(126 * 108 / 145, 126 * 39 / 145)

# Calculate the coordinates of X using the ratio AX/CX = 13/36
k = sp.Rational(18, 7)
X = sp.Point(13 * 108 / 49, 13 * 39 / 49)

# Calculate the circumcircle of triangle ABX
circumcircle = sp.Circle(A, B, X)

# Define the line CY, which is the perpendicular bisector of BC
perpendicular_bisector = sp.Line((54, 0), slope=sp.oo)

# Find the intersection of the circumcircle and the perpendicular bisector to get Y
Y = circumcircle.intersection(perpendicular_bisector)[0]

# Define the line XY
line_XY = sp.Line(X, Y)

# Find the intersection of line XY with BC
E = line_XY.intersection(sp.Line(B, C))[0]

# Calculate the length of BE
BE = B.distance(E)

# Simplify the fraction
BE_simplified = sp.simplify(BE)
m, n = BE_simplified.as_numer_denom()

# Calculate m + n
result = m + n
